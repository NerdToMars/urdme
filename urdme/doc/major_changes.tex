\section{Summary of major changes}
\label{sec:changes}

Below, we summarize the major changes compared to
URDME~1.1~\cite{URDMEman2}.
\begin{itemize}
\item URDME~1.2 includes support for Comsol~Multiphysics~4.x as well
  as Comsol~Multiphysics~3.5a. The support for
  Comsol~Multiphysics~3.5a will be removed in a coming release of
  URDME.

\item The syntax of the Matlab interface has been refined, essentially
  by moving the model-properties from \textit{fem.urdme} to the
  structure \textit{umod} and storing the Comsol Multiphysics geometry
  in the field \textit{umod.comsol}.

\item Basic SBML support has been added into URDME, allowing for
  translation of SBML level 2 files into URDME \textit{model} and
  \textit{propensity files} with the external script
  \textit{sbml2urdme}.

\item The solvers can be compiled and executed without any Matlab dependencies using a new, in-house library for reading .mat files. This feature does not support the full set of Matlab data-structures, but is compatible with the NSM and DFSP solvers. It is disabled by default. To enable it, define URDME\_LIBMAT in '/build/Makefile.nsm'. 
\item Propensities for \emph{mass-action models} can be defined directly in the Matlab model file as \emph{inline propensities}. 

\end{itemize}
