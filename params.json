{"name":"URDME","tagline":"Stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation on unstructured meshes.","body":"### Welcome to the URDME Webpage.\r\nURDME is a general software framework for modeling and simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes on unstructured, tetrahedral and triangular meshes. URDME emphasizes modularity in order to be useful both as a simulation tool and as a framework for developemnt of stochastic simulation algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Quick Start \r\n\r\nDownload the latest stable release and unpack it, alternatively clone the repository (requires a git client). In a terminal type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/URDME/urdme.git\r\n$ sudo ./install.sh\r\n```\r\nConsult the software manual in _doc/manual.pdf_ for further instructions, examples and tutorials. \r\n\r\n### System requirements and software dependencies\r\n* Linux or Apple OSX operating system.\r\n* Matlab\r\n\t- Tested versions: 2007a, 2008a, 2008b, 2009a, 2009b, 2011b, 2012a, 2014b. Command line interface must be installed. \r\n     \r\n* Comsol multiphysics 3.5a (with appropriate patches) or Comsol multiphysics 4.x \r\n\t- Tested versions: 3.5a, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.3b (recommended)\r\n\t- Must have Matlab integration components installed\r\n* GCC (Xcode on Apple computers+command-line tools)\r\n    - Executables gcc and make must be in the path\r\n    - Standard libraries must be installed\r\n* The optional SBML support requires additionally\r\n\t- Python runtime libraries 2.6 or higher\r\n  \t- SBML library for python (libsbml)\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\nURDME 1.2.
